	 * 		1. Primitive Data types : A primitive data type is pre-defined by the programming language. 
	 * 		The size and type of variable values are specified, and it has no additional methods.
	 * 
	 * 		2. Non - primitive Data types : These data types are not actually defined by the programming
	 * 		 language but are created by the programmer. They are also called â€œreference variablesâ€? or â€œobject
	 *   	referencesâ€? since they reference a memory location which stores the data.
